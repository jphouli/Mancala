# Mancala Game

## Description
If you have no idea what Mancala is or how to play it, I didn't have any idea how it worked when I was building it out either. 
Mancala is an extremely old board game with many different kinds of "formal" and "house" rules which completely change either
the way the board is structured or played.

## MY Game Rules
To play my version of Mancala, there's going to be a board consisting of two sides. The smaller tiles are going to be clickable/usable
tiles and the big tiles on each end are the score tiles. Think of each tile as having a marble in it, like how the game is portrayed in
real life, and the goal of each player is to remove every marble from their side of the board so they have 0's in all of their tiles. On 
each player's turn, they're allowed to click/move their marbles, which means that they have to take all of the marbles out of that tile
and place 1 marble in each subsequent tile clockwise until they've used all of the marbles from that beginning tile. The big catch of the 
game is that whenever a person can perfectly place a marble in their opponent's score tile, they have a free extra turn. I hope you have fun
with the small game!

## Setup
I made this project using WinForms applications on C#. If you clone the repository down, there will be two solution/executable files that
can be able to run the program. Whichever ones you choose doesn't matter, as long as you have both the client and server projects running 
together. After having the projects boot up, you can set up who goes first and setup a connection! 

## Final Thoughts
I know this project might be a little more on the primitive side, but this has got to be one of my favorite programming projects I've made!
